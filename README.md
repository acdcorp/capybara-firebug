capybara-firebug provides a dead-simple way to run Capybara-based Cucumber
scenarios or RSpec request specs with Firebug enabled under the selenium driver.

To use it in RSpec examples, `require 'capybara/firebug/rspec'` in spec_helper.rb,
and tag the examples you need to debug with `:firebug => true`.

To use it in Cucumber scenarios, `require 'capybara/firebug/cucumber'` in env.rb,
and tag the scenarios you need to debug with `@firebug`.

## ACDCORP versions
We are hosting several gems that our projects are using because bundle requires
them from the custom fork or original repo where they can get updates and crash our
projects, therefore, every gem fork contains the following branch(es):

  * fork-stable => Stable or initial branch from the fork
  * x.x-acdcorp-stable => custom stable version
  * master => continues development and tracking original repos

## Firebug Versions

By default, this gem uses Firebug 2.0.2, which is compatible with Firefox 30-32.

If you want to use Firebug 1.12.8 (compatible with Firefox 23+), you
need to explicitly specify the firebug_version setting in your `capybara.rb`
support file:

    # located in features/support/capybara.rb or similar
    require 'capybara/firebug'
    Selenium::WebDriver::Firefox::Profile.firebug_version = '1.12.8'

## Customizing the Profile

If you wish to further customize the Firefox profile used by selenium, you
can use the `#enable_firebug` method to add the Firebug extension to it:

    profile = Selenium::WebDriver::Firefox::Profile.new
    profile.enable_firebug

This can also be used to enable Firebug on a remote browser:

    Capybara::Driver::Selenium.new(app,
       :browser => :remote,
       :url => "http://my.ip.add.ress:4444/wd/hub",
       :desired_capabilities => Selenium::WebDriver::Remote::Capabilities.firefox(:firefox_profile => profile))

## Upgrading from 1.x

Cucumber and RSpec support has been split into separate files. You'll need to change
spec_helper.rb to `require 'capybara/firebug/rspec'` or env.rb to `require 'capybara/firebug/cucumber'`.

A "stop and let me debug" step definition is no longer provided. You can add it
yourself if needed:

```
Then /^stop and let me debug$/ do
  debugger
end
```

Ruby 1.8.x is no longer supported. Please upgrade to 2.0 or later.
